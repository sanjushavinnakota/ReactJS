 <h1>Bhagavan Krishna Pada-Padme Prarthana</h1>
  <p>(refrain)</p><p>
krishna taba punya habe bhai
e-punya koribe jabe radharani khusi habe
dhruva ati boli toma tai</p>
<p>
I emphatically say to you, O brothers, you will obtain your good fortune from the Supreme Lord Krishna only when Srimati Radharani becomes pleased with you.
</p>
<p>
<p>(1)</p>
sri-siddhanta saraswati saci-suta priya ati
krishna-sebaya jara tula nai
sei se mohanta-guru jagater madhe uru
krishna-bhakti dey thai thai</p>
<p>
Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, who is very dear to Lord Gauranga, the son of mother Saci, is unparalleled in his service to the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna. He is that great saintly spiritual master who bestows intense devotion to Krishna at different places throughout the world.
</p>
<p>
<p>(2)</p>
tara iccha balavan pascatyete than than
hoy jate gauranger nam
prithivite nagaradi asamudra nada nadi
sakalei loy krishna nam
</p>
<p>
By his strong desire, the holy name of Lord Gauranga will spread throughout all the countries of the Western world. In all the cities, towns, and villages on the earth, from all the oceans, seas, rivers, and streams, everyone will chant the holy name of Krishna.
</p>
<p>
<p>(3)</p>
tahale ananda hoy tabe hoy digvijay
caitanyer kripa atisay
maya dushta jata duhkhi jagate sabai sukhi
vaishnaver iccha purna hoy
</p>
<p>
As the vast mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu conquers all directions, a flood of transcendental ecstasy will certainly cover the land. When all the sinful, miserable living entities become happy, the Vaishnavas' desire is then fulfilled.
</p><p>
<p>(4)</p>
se karja je koribare ajna jadi dilo more
jogya nahi an dina hina
tai se tomara kripa magitechi anurupa
aji tumi sabar pravina
</p>
<p>
Although my Guru Maharaja ordered me to accomplish this mission, I am not worthy or fit to do it. I am very fallen and insignificant. Therefore, O Lord, now I am begging for Your mercy so that I may become worthy, for You are the wisest and most experienced of all.
</p>
<p>
<p>(5)</p>
tomara se sakti pele guru-sebaya bastu mile
jibana sarthak jadi hoy
sei se seva paile tahale sukhi hale
taba sanga bhagyate miloy
</p>
<p>
If You bestow Your power, by serving the spiritual master one attains the Absolute Truth-one's life becomes successful. If that service is obtained, then one becomes happy and gets Your association due to good fortune.
</p>
<p>
<p>(6)</p>
evam janam nipatitam prabhavahikupe
kamabhikamam anu yah prapatan prasangat
kritvatmasat surarshina bhagavan grihitah
so 'ham katham nu visrije tava bhritya-sevam
</p>
<p>
My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, because of my association with material desires, one after another, I was gradually falling into a blind well full of snakes, following the general populace. But Your servant Narada Muni kindly accepted me as his disciple and instructed me how to achieve this transcendental position. Therefore, my first duty is to serve him. How could I leave his service? (Prahlada Maharaja to Lord Nrisimha-deva, Bhag. 7.9.28)
</p>
<p>
<p>(7)</p>
tumi mor cira sathi bhuliya mayar lathi
khaiyachi janma-janmantare
aji punah e sujoga jadi hoy jogayoga
tabe pari tuhe milibare
</p>
<p>
O Lord Krishna, You are my eternal companion. Forgetting You, I have suffered the kicks of maya birth after birth. If today the chance to meet You occurs again, then I will surely be able to rejoin You.
</p>
<p>
<p>(8)</p>
tomara milane bhai abar se sukha pai
gocarane ghuri din bhor
kata bane chutachuti bane khai lutaputi
sei din kabe habe mor
</p>
<p>

O dear friend, in Your company I will experience great joy once again. In the early morning I will wander about the cowherd pastures and fields. Running and frolicking in the many forests of Vraja, I will roll on the ground in spiritual ecstasy. Oh when will that day be mine?
</p>
<p>
<p>(9)</p>
aji se subidhane tomara smarana bhela
baro asa dakilam tai
ami tomara nitya-dasa tai kori eta asa
tumi bina anya gati nai
</p>
<p>
Today that remembrance of You came to me in a very nice way. Because I have a great longing I called to You. I am Your eternal servant and therefore I desire Your association so much. O Lord Krishna, except for You there is no other means of success.</p>
