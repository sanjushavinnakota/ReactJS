  <h3>The Devotees Die, and the Nondevotees Also Die. What is the Difference?</h3>
 <p>One may ask, "The devotees die, and the nondevotees also die. What is the difference?”
It is like this: The mother cat may catch a rat and carry it in her mouth, and she also carries her kittens in her mouth. It is the same mouth, but the kittens are comfortable and safe, whereas the rat is feeling the jaws of death. Similarly, ot the time of death the devotees are transferred to the spiritual realm, Vaikunta, whereas the ordinary sinful man is dragged Wy down to the hellish regions by the Yamadutas, the constables of Yamaraja. This was apparently to be Ajamila’s fate.</p>

 <p>In the Bhagavad-gita (4.9) Krishna says, janma karma ca me divyam: "My appearance and disappearanceare spiritual, transcendental; they are not ordinary." Why does Krishna appear in this world? That He explains in the previous verse (Bg. 4.8):</p>
 <p>parifranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrfam</p>

 <p>"To deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, | appear millennium after millennium." Gods only business is to protect the faithful devotees and to kill the demoniac. Therefore we find Lord Vishnu pictured with His weapons, the club and chakra (disc), for protecting the devotees, and the lotus flower and conch for their benediction.</p>
 <p>Similarly transcendental are the appearance and disappearance of Krishna's devotees who are sent to this material world to preach the glories of the Lord. According fo the principles of Vaishnavisam, both the appearance and the disappearance of such Vaishnavas, or devotees of Vishnu (Krishna), are all-auspicious. Therefore we hold festivals in their honor on the anniversaries of both days.</p>
